Scripts for handling the data

Icelandic and Swedish data come from the HMD, so their scripts follow the same standard.
Ukrainian data come from Mesle and Vallin and need to be merged into a dataset for each sex. For Ukraine, fist run the script "1 - Merging data Ukraine 1933", then the script "2 - Handling data Ukraine 1933". The second script follows the same standard as the ones for Iceland and Sweden.

The script "Data functions" contains the functions used for reshaping the data and calculating the indices. It does not need to be run, as it is called directly in each "Hndling data" script.
